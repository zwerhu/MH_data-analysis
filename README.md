This repository details a robust, data-driven, and participatory analytical framework—a citizen science initiative—designed for the strategic placement and development of multimodal Mobility Hubs (MHs) in diverse urban environments, exemplified by case studies in Gainesville, Florida. The methodology systematically identifies and prioritizes investment locations by analyzing clusters of existing or planned transit stops.
The framework utilizes a multi-criteria analysis, evaluating First-/Last-Mile (FM/LM) Connectivity. The citizen science component involves engaging the public to critique the results and methodology through community feedback via interactive mapping surveys and stakeholder input. This ensures quantitative results are validated against potential users' lived experiences, leading to hubs that effectively enhance accessibility, particularly for transportation-disadvantaged populations. To promote transparency and adoption, the repository includes the final analytic outputs and the complete analytical tools: a set of Python scripts and the underlying HTML format maps that were generated.
